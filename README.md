# Multiclass Classification Problem

## About
This project had the goal of building a neural network to solve a classification problem. Briefly, the problem is about identifying in which part of the cell is some protein can be found. This work was made using the open source library TensorFlow and the Keras API. The Neural Network created is a Multi-Layer Perceptron with a built-in hidden layer, and many flexible options.
